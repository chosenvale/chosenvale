The West Brethren's Shop was constructed in 1820 and originally stood in the second row, behind the East Brethren's Shop. Along with the East Brethren's Shop it was moved to its current location in 1834 to make way for the construction of the Great Stone Dwelling. It was used as a woodworking shop by the Shaker Brothers.

The La Salettes converted the building to be used as a theater. Today it houses Museum exhibits and workshop space.
