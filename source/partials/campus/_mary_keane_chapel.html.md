The Mary Keane Chapel was built by the Missionaries of Our Lady of La Salette between 1930 and 1931 to designs by Donat R. Baribault of Springfield, Massachusetts.

The sanctuary features a renowned Casavant organ and spectacular German stained glass produced by the Zettler Studios.

This unique historic structure speaks eloquently of the second phase of the site's two hundred year inhabitation by religious organizations.
