Tim Feeney seeks to explore and examine the timbral possibilities inherent
in everyday found and built objects.  He treats his percussion setup as a
friction instrument, using bows, scrapers, and rosined drumheads to capture
and amplify frequencies that go unheard when an object is struck with a
traditional mallet.  He supplements this acoustic console with an electronic
instrument, arranged from mixers, contact microphones, and effects pedals,
that synthesizes and alters the spectral characteristics of low-fidelity tones,
feedback, and noise.

Tim works within Boston's timbral improvising community, a group of
musicians interested in unstable sounds and silences, exploring austere
combinations of sound and the otherworldly ripple effects that pulse through
a silent space and alert ears.  He has performed with musicians including
thereminist James Coleman, cellist/electronic musician Vic Rawlings,
tape-deck manipulator Howard Stelzer, trumpeter Nate Wooley, sound
artists Jed Speare and Ernst Karel, saxophonist Jack Wright, and the trio
ONDA.  His concerts have been held at experimental spaces such as the
Red Room in Baltimore, Boston's Institute of Contemporary Art, Firehouse
12 in New Haven, Connecticut, the Knitting Factory New York, and the Stone,
as well as the Center for New Music and Audio Technology at UC-Berkeley,
the Stanford Art Museum, Princeton University, and Dartmouth College.

Tim's double life as an interpreter of contemporary compositions has led him
to venues such as the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Zankel Hall, and the
Norfolk Chamber Music Festival, and his work has been featured on WNYC
Radio's New Sounds.  A member of Boston's Callithumpian Consort, Tim has
appeared on the Musica Nova series at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig, Germany,   
and at New York's Tonic, as part of its 50th birthday celebration for John
Zorn.  As a founding member of the So Percussion Group, Tim appeared in
concerts and masterclasses at Columbia University and Williams College,
and commissioned David Lang's The So-Called Laws of Nature, premiered
at the 2001 Bang on a Can Marathon.  He is a co-founder of the duo
Non Zero, with saxophonist Brian Sacawa, which has performed American
and world premieres of works in concerts at MIT, NYU, the University of
Michigan, the Kerrytown Concert Hall, New York's Tenri Cultural Institute, and
Eastern Nazarene College.

An active educator, Tim has given workshops on improvisation, chamber music
and solo percussion performance, Ewe dance-drumming, and Balinese gamelan
schools including at the University of Miami, Longy School of Music,
UC-Davis, Bucknell University, and the Peabody Conservatory.  He earned the  
Doctor of Musical Arts degree from the Yale School of Music in 2007, and
currently teaches at Cornell University.
