“Håkan Hardenberger, the cleanest, subtlest trumpet player on earth.” –The Times

Håkan Hardenberger is one of the world’s leading soloists, consistently recognized for his phenomenal performances and tireless innovation. Alongside his performances of the classical repertory, he is also renowned as a pioneer of significant and virtuosic new trumpet works.

Håkan Hardenberger performs with the world’s leading orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, Boston Symphony, NHK Symphony Orchestra, Wiener Philharmoniker, Swedish Radio Symphony, Berliner Philharmoniker and Philharmonia Orchestra, who built a series around him in 2015/2016. Conductors he regularly collaborates with include Alan Gilbert, Daniel Harding, Paavo Järvi, Ingo Metzmacher, Andris Nelsons, John Storgårds and David Zinman.

The works written for and championed by Hardenberger stand as key highlights in the repertory and include those by Sir Harrison Birtwistle, Brett Dean, Hans Werner Henze, Rolf Martinsson, Olga Neuwirth, Arvo Pärt, Mark-Anthony Turnage, Rolf Wallin and HK Gruber’s concerto Aerial, which has received its 70th performance by Hardenberger with Berliner Philharmoniker in 2015.

In summer 2016, Hardenberger returns to the BBC Proms, marking exactly 30 years since his debut at the festival. He will perform with BBC Symphony Orchestra and has curated a chamber music Prom at Cadogan Hall. Highlights of the 2016/2017 season include a residency with Orchestre Philharmonique de Radio France—which will showcase him as a concerto artist, a conductor and play/director—tours with St Louis Symphony and London Symphony Orchestra and returns to Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks and Het Concertgebouw Orkest.

Conducting has become an integral part of Hardenberger’s music making. He conducts orchestras such as BBC Philharmonic, Saint Paul and Swedish Chamber Orchestras, Dresden Philharmonic, RTE National Symphony Dublin, Real Filharmonia Galicia and Malmö Symphony. In recital he has duo partnerships with percussionist Colin Currie and pianist Roland Pöntinen. He will appear this season with Pöntinen at London’s Wigmore Hall and at San Francisco Performances. He is also Artistic Director of Malmö Chamber Music, a new international chamber music festival, launching September 2016.

His extensive discography on the Philips, EMI, Deutsche Grammophon, BIS and Ondine labels includes his latest recording with Bergen Philharmonic/ John Storgårds of Rolf Wallin’s concerto Fisher King. Previous discs feature the Academy of St Martin in the Fields with new arrangements of popular film and pop melodies (BIS), a Gruber and Schwertsik disc with the Swedish Chamber Orchestra (BIS) and his trumpet concerto CD with the Gothenburg Symphony (DG).

Hardenberger was born in Malmö, Sweden. He began studying the trumpet at the age of eight with Bo Nilsson in Malmö and continued his studies at the Paris Conservatoire, with Pierre Thibaud, and in Los Angeles with Thomas Stevens. He is a professor at the Malmö Conservatoire.
