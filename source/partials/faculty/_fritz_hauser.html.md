With solo concerts, in different small and large groups, in multi media projects (theatre / dance / film / radio / architecture), and with numerous recordings, he has contributed to the development of the drumset from a mere timekeeper to an instrument. His concert tours have taken him around the world.

In the area of improvised music he has collaborated with a whole list of musicians. Urs Leimgruber, Joelle Leandre, Marilyn Crispell, Christy Doran, Lauren Newton, Patrick Demenga, and Michael Askill.
