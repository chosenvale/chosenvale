Markus Stockhausen is one of the most versatile musicians of our time. He studied initially at the Cologne Musikhochschule and is as much at home in jazz as in contemporary and classical music. For about 25 years he collaborated closely with his father, the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who has composed many beautiful works for him. With his brother Simon he realised several internationally acclaimed musical projects.

As soloist, improviser and composer Markus Stockhausen is in international demand. He leads or collaborates in various jazz ensembles with musicians like Arild Andersen, Patrice Héral, Vladyslav Sendecki (Electric Treasures), Angelo Comisso (Trio Lichtblick), Ferenc Snétberger and plays contemporary and intuitive music in the duo Moving Sounds with clarinetist Tara Bouman, as well as with long standing musician-friends like Stefano Scodanibbio, Mark Nauseef and Fabrizio Ottaviucci. His new group Eternal Voyage features musicians from India, Greece and Lebanon. Since February 2000 he directs a concert series called Klangvisionen with intuitive music in the church of St. Maternus in Cologne, together with Rolf Zavelberg, who does the artful light design.

As a composer he has received commissions from, among others, the RIAS Chamber Choir, The London Sinfonietta, the Orchestra d‘Archi Italiana, the Winterthur Chamber Orchestra, the Cheltenham Music Festival and The 12 Cellists from the Berlin Philharmonic. In 2007 he wrote „Tanzendes Licht“ for trumpet, big band and string orchestra for the Swiss Jazz Orchestra and the Camerata Bern, as well as „Symbiosis“, a double concerto for clarinet and trumpet with string orchestra, written for the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra. In 2009 he wrote Olivers Abenteuer for children’s orchestra.

Markus Stockhausen also composes for film, teaches in various situations, including Intuitive Music and More and Singing and Silence has released or participated in more than 60 CDs until now. In 2005 he was the winner of the WDR jazz prize.
