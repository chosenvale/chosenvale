Careful observation of the past fifty years or so of musical study has identified two alarming trends â€” a rigid separation of performers from composers, composers from performers, (and audiences from both!) and an inflexible specialization by young musicians, training to gain a professional foothold in a rapidly changing musical world.

Musical societies in the coming decades will require musicians to be increasingly flexible, original, and to have an ever broadening set of skills. We believe that rather than simply fostering a steady accumulation of inert, skill-based knowledge, each and every musician should be focusing on developing a wide-ranging and original musical voice in order to become the type of artist who will thrive in the emerging world. Music education has to not only keep pace with change, it must foster change as well.

As traditional ways and places to make music evolve, musicians will be required to be increasingly original and entrepreneurial. Total musical immersion at the Center for Advanced Musical Studies will illuminate paths that develop individual musical invention in parallel with musical discipline.
