As reflected in her recently commissioned works, Rotations for twelve choreographed musicians and carousel organ and Trading Futures for six hundred choreographed found sound surfaces, Stephanie’s theatrical tendencies often result in compositional collaborations of sound, sight and movement.</p>

<p>Stephanie has become a prominent voice in experimental improvisation, collaborating with artists such as improvisational pioneers Henry Threadgill, Butch Morris, John Zorn and Anthony Braxton, composer Helmut Lachenmann and performance artists Mike Kelly, Laurie Anderson and Yoko Ono.  As a founding member of Asphalt Orchestra, created by the new music collective Bang on a Can, Stephanie has worked with David Byrne, St. Vincent, Susan Marshall, Tyondai Braxton among others, and has also performed alongside Kronos Quartet, The Pixies, Kanye West, A-Trak and Common.</p>

<p>Championing new music, Stephanie has premiered her own works from stages as varied as Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center to smaller iconic stages at the Blue Note and The Stone. While her performances survey a panorama of musical genres ranging from free improvisation, jazz, hip hop, punk and contemporary classical music, it is the collaboration with space and surface that unifies Stephanie’s creative pursuits. She holds degrees from the Eastman School of Music, McGill University, California Institute of the Arts and has held residency at Stanford University. A recent addition to the faculty of music at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Stephanie continues to encourage the performance and commissioning of jazz and new music as Vice-President of the Festival of New Trumpet (FONT) alongside trumpeter Dave Douglas.</p>

Praised for his outstanding technical capabilities and sensitive musicality, his repertoire encompasses every epoch, from baroque to contemporary music and jazz.</p>

<p>He has appeared as a soloist with leading orchestras including the NHK Symphony, Vienna Symphony, Konzerthausorchester Berlin, NDR Symphony Orchestra and the Orchestre Philharmoniques of Strasbourg and Luxembourg, under conductors such as Alan Gilbert, Yakov Kreizberg, Jun Märkl and Matthias Pintscher. He is a regular guest of internationally renowned music festivals including the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival, Niedersächsische Musiktage, Takefu International Music Festival in Japan, Ars Musica in Belgium, Festspiele Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the Rheingau Musik Festival.</p>

<p>Placing the standard repertoire for trumpet in ingenious programmes and unusual contexts has become Jeroen Berwaerts’ calling card. One such programme places Handel’s Music for the Royal Fireworks and dances from Rameau’s opera Dardarus alongside chansons by Jacques Brel. The singing part in such programmes is generally taken by Jeroen Berwaerts himself, who has completed jazz vocal studies at the Royal Conservatory of Ghent alongside his active career as a trumpeter.</p>

<p>Jeroen Berwaerts’ extraordinary commitment to contemporary music is evident in the numerous premieres he has given, including Toshio Hosokawa’s second trumpet concerto Im Nebel and Francesco Filidei’s Carnevale. After Håkan Hardenberger he was the second trumpeter worldwide to add HK Gruber’s Busking (2007) to his repertoire. Following the high praise he received at the Musikfest Hamburg and the Bregenz Festival in 2014, this season he will perform Busking with the Bochum Symphony and the German Philharmonic Orchestra Rhineland-Palatinate.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the 2017/18 season he will give performances of Péter Eötvös’ Jet Stream and Snatches of a Conversation with the Hungarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Toshio Hosokawa’s Voyage VII with the Ensemble Resonanz at the Budapest Spring Festival. He will be joined by pianist Boris Giltburg for Shostakovich’s Concerto for Piano, Trumpet and Orchestra with the Kammerphilharmonie Bremen under Paavo Järvi – a work he will return to later this season with his long-standing chamber music partner Alexander Melnikov, together with the Swedish Dala Sinfonietta and the Finnish Tapiola Sinfonietta.</p>

<p>In 2017, Jeroen Berwaerts’ discography was complemented by the album Signals from Heaven, recorded with Salaputia Brass, with whom he is trumpeter, jazz-vocalist and ensemble director. His recording of Paul Hindemith’s trumpet sonata with Alexander Melnikov was released on Harmonia Mundi in 2015. He has already recorded Shostakovich’s Concerto for Piano, Trumpet and Orchestra under Teodor Currentzis with the Mahler Chamber Orchestra which was released in 2012, the same year as his recording of Toshio Hosokawa’s Voyage VII with the Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg.</p>

<p>Jeroen Berwaerts studied in Karlsruhe with the celebrated trumpet-virtuoso Reinhold Friedrich. Since 2008, he has been a Professor of Trumpet at the Hochschule für Musik in Hannover. He is an official Yamaha Artist.</p>

His repertoire now includes an impressive list of works written for him, including some of the most important pieces to be added to the percussion repertoire in recent years. Jennifer Higdon’s “Percussion Concerto”, dedicated to Colin, and premiered in November 2005 with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Christoph Eschenbach has become a classic, receiving more than forty performances so far. Steve Mackey’s “Time Release”, commissioned by four prestigious European groups and given its US premiere in February 2008 with The Baltimore Symphony at Carnegie Hall is another work that has pushed the art form further, both technically and musically. May 2008 saw the “staggering premiere”(Guardian Newspaper) of Simon Holt’s “a table of noises” which went on to win a British Composers Award in 2009, the first percussion concerto ever to do so. 2009 also saw the premiere of Kurt Schwertsik’s marimba concerto and Einojuhani Rautavaara’s concerto “Incantations” with both works programmed extensively in seasons to come. Many other works feature in his repertoire, and Colin enjoys a close relationship with both James MacMillan’s “Veni, Veni, Emmanuel” and Christopher Rouse’s “Der Gerette Alberich”, with well over 140 performances given thus far between these two works.</p>

<p>Highly regarded among colleagues, he has enjoyed various close collaborations with artists such as Katia and Marielle Labeque, The Los Angeles Guitar Quartet, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Joshua Bell, and an increasing focus on the duo formed with trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger.

For about 25 years he collaborated closely with his father, the composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, who has composed many beautiful works for him. Markus’s approach to the creation of “intuitive music” is influenced by post-bop, free jazz, world music, electronica, classical and ambient music, and takes advantage of his outstanding command of the instrument. </p>

<p>An early recording with pianist Rainer Brüninghaus (Continuum, ECM) finds him weaving intricate and electrifying lines on trumpet, flugelhorn and piccolo trumpet. His subsequent work with bassist Gary Peacock, guitarist Ralph Towner, his frequent collaborations with bassist Arild Andersen and percussionist Patrice Héral (Kàrta, Joyosa, Electric Treasures), his numerous duo collaborations, notably with Tara Bouman on clarinets: Moving Sounds, with jazz pianist Florian Weber: Inside Out, with the hungarian guitar virtuoso Ferenc Snétberger, and earlier on with his brother, Simon Stockhausen, his new quartett called Quadrivium with cellist Jörg Brinkmann, pianist Angelo Comisso and drummer Christian Thomé, as well as his solo concerts, often together with a special light design by Rolf Zavelberg, have all yielded fresh perspectives.</p>

<p>As a composer he has received commissions from, among others, the RIAS Chamber Choir, The London Sinfonietta, the Orchestra d‘Archi Italiana, the Winterthur Chamber Orchestra, the Cheltenham Music Festival and The 12 Cellists from the Berlin Philharmonic. In 2007 he wrote „Tanzendes Licht“ for trumpet, big band and string orchestra for the Swiss Jazz Orchestra and the Camerata Bern, as well as „Symbiosis“, a double concerto for clarinet and trumpet with string orchestra, comissioned by the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra. In 2009 he composed „Oliver’s Adventures“ for children’s orchestra and choir, in 2011 „Yin“ and „Yang“ for the Metropole Orchestra, premiered at the Muziekgebouw Amsterdam for the Holland Festival. Also in 2011 he wrote „GeZEITen“ for about 600 musicians, comissioned by the Niedersächsische Musiktage in Cuxhaven. In 2012: „Ein Glasperlenspiel“ for solo trumpet and accordeon orchestra, 2013: „Das Erwachende Herz“ for solo trumpet, clarinet, voice and symphony orchestra, comissioned and performed by the Hamburger Symphoniker.</p>

<p>More than 80 CDs document his work. Regularly he gives workshops on Intuitive Music and More and seminars in Singing and Silence. For more info see <a href="http://www.markusstockhausen.com">www.markusstockhausen.com</a></p>

The son of the principal trumpeter of the Radio Symphony Orchestra and an amateur actress, Pedro was brought up around concerts, rehearsals and performances. He started learning piano as a small child, but quickly switched to cello and trumpet. As a hyperactive child he was seduced by percussion: the wealth of sounds, timbres, instruments and sonic invention – and has always been immersed in music, also composing and conducting. Carneiro entered the percussion class at the National Conservatoire in Lisbon when he was 12. He moved to London on a scholarship from the Gulbenkian Foundation and studied percussion with David Corkhill and conducting with Alan Hazeldine, at the Guidhall School of Music and Drama. Later on, he studied conducting with Emilio Pomàrico at the Scuola Civica in Milan.</p>

<p>Today, Pedro Carneiro is acclaimed internationally as one of the world’s foremost solo classical percussionists and increasingly active as a conductor and composer. Pedro’s virtuosity, passion, explosive energy and emotional spontaneity have inspired several of today’s leading composers to write works specially for him. He has performed the world première of over 100 new works and collaborates regularly with a wide range of acclaimed musicians. An enthusiastic chamber musician, Carneiro has commissioned, performed and recorded over a dozen new quintets for marimba and string quartet, in the company of the Tokyo, Arditti, Shanghai, Latinoamericano, New Zealand and Chilingirian string quartets.</p>

<p>He performs and records with many orchestras around the globe, such as the Los Angeles Philharmonic, Helsinki Philharmonic, Vienna Chamber Orchestra, Swedish Chamber Orchestra, Seattle Symphony, Leipzig Radio Symphony, English Chamber Orchestra, São Paulo State Symphony, BBC National Orchestra of Wales, to name a few. He also appears regularly as a soloist/director, conducting from the marimba keyboard.</p>

<p>Deeply committed to the musical development of his home country and fostering the work of fellow young musicians, he co-founded the Portuguese Chamber Orchestra in 2007, which he serves as artistic director and chief conductor. In a very short period of time, the Portuguese Chamber Orchestra – an exciting group of some of the nation’s top young professional musicians – has become the “Orchestra in Residence” at the Centro Cultural de Belém (Lisbon), performing their own concert series to sell-out audiences as well as touring nationally and internationally to impressive critical acclaim.</p>

<p>Pedro is also a passionate inventor: he has created many new accessories which are now entering the repertoire and being used by percussionists around the world; and is a keen improviser, performing in many experimental performances, often using live electronics and cutting-edge technology.</p>

<p>His extensive discography includes several prize-winning recordings and features solo recitals, chamber music and concerti – on the ECM, Zig-Zag Territoires, Rattle, Stradivarius and other labels.</p>

Lang is at the same time deeply versed in the classical tradition and committed to music that resists categorization, constantly creating new forms.</p>

<p>In the words of The New Yorker, “With his winning of the Pulitzer Prize for the little match girl passion (one of the most original and moving scores of recent years), Lang, once a post-minimalist enfant terrible, has solidified his standing as an American master.”
Many of Lang’s pieces resemble each other only in the fierce intelligence and clarity of vision that inform their structures. His catalogue is extensive, and his opera, orchestra, chamber and solo works are by turns ominous, ethereal, urgent, hypnotic, unsettling and very emotionally direct. Much of his work seeks to expand the definition of virtuosity in music — even the deceptively simple pieces can be fiendishly difficult to play and require incredible concentration by musicians and audiences alike.</p>

<p>the little match girl passion, commissioned by Carnegie Hall for Paul Hillier’s vocal ensemble Theater of Voices, was awarded the 2008 Pulitzer Prize for music. Of the piece, Pulitzer-juror and Washington Post columnist Tim Page said, “I don’t think I’ve ever been so moved by a new, and largely unheralded, composition as I was by David Lang’s little match girl passion, which is unlike any music I know.”</p>

<p>Other recent projects include: (concerto) world to come, premiered by cellist Maya Beiser and the Norrlands Operans Symfoniorkester; darker, premiered by Ensemble Musiques Nouvelles; plainspoken, a new work for the New York City Ballet; writing on water, for the London Sinfonietta, with libretto and visuals by English filmmaker Peter Greenaway; the difficulty of crossing a field, a fully-staged opera for the Kronos Quartet; loud love songs, a concerto for the percussionist Evelyn Glennie; and the oratorio Shelter, with co-composers Michael Gordon and Julia Wolfe, at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, staged by Ridge Theater and featuring the Norwegian vocal ensemble Trio Mediaeval.</p>

<p>Lang is one of America’s most performed composers. “There is no name yet for this kind of music,” wrote Los Angeles Times music critic Mark Swed of Lang’s work, but audiences around the globe are hearing more and more of it, in performances by such organizations as Santa Fe Opera, the New York Philharmonic, the Netherlands Chamber Choir, the Boston Symphony, the Munich Chamber Orchestra, and the Kronos Quartet; at Tanglewood, the BBC Proms, The Munich Biennale, the Settembre Musica Festival, the Sidney 2000 Olympic Arts Festival and the Almeida, Holland, Berlin, and Strasbourg Festivals; in theater productions in New York, San Francisco and London; alongside the choreography of Twyla Tharp, La La La Human Steps, The Netherlands Dance Theater and the Paris Opera Ballet; and at Lincoln Center, the Southbank Centre, Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, the Barbican Centre, and the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>

<p>Lang is the recipient of numerous honors and awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, the Rome Prize, the BMW Music-Theater Prize (Munich), and grants from the Guggenheim Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters. In 1999, he received a Bessie Award for his music in choreographer Susan Marshall’s The Most Dangerous Room in the House, performed live by the Bang on a Can All-Stars at the Next Wave Festival of the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The Carbon Copy Building won the 2000 Village Voice OBIE Award for Best New American Work. The recording of The Passing Measures, on Cantaloupe Records, was named one of the best CDs of 2001 by The New Yorker. His recent CD Pierced, on Naxos, was praised both on the rock music site Pitchfork and in the classical magazine Gramophone, and was called his “most exciting new work in years” by the San Francisco Chronicle. The commercial recording of the little match girl passion, released on Harmonia Mundi, received the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Small Ensemble Performance.</p>

<p>Lang is co-founder and co-artistic director of New York’s legendary music collective Bang on a Can. His work has been recorded on the Sony Classical, Harmonia Mundi, Teldec, BMG, Point, Chandos, Argo/Decca, and Cantaloupe labels, among others.</p>

<p>His music is published by Red Poppy Music (ASCAP) and is distributed worldwide by G. Schirmer, Inc.</p>

Glenn&#39;s various stints with groups and ensembles have resulted in participation in over 90 albums to date, including three recorded solo works, the most recent of which, Mobile (Nonesuch Records, 2006) was released to critical acclaim from such publications as the Guardian &amp; the New York Times.</p>

<p>Kotche has received international attention for his &quot;unfailing taste, technique and discipline&quot; (Chicago Tribune), and has been commissioned to write pieces for Kronos Quartet, Bang on a Can All-Stars and So Percussion . In addition to collaborating with renowned contemporary music sextet Eighth Blackbird, Kotche&#39;s compositions have been performed at venues as wide-ranging as Highland Park&#39;s Ravinia, Carnegie&#39;s Zankel Hall in New York and Teatro Castro Alves in Salvador, Brasil.

<p>In addition to his work as a composer and solo percussionist, Kotche is member of the ground-breaking American rock band Wilco, with whom he has played since 2001. The first album recorded after Kotche joined the group, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was met with critical and mass acclaim with Rolling Stone magazine recently calling it the 3rd best album of the decade. Follow-up albums include the Grammy-winning A Ghost is Born, Sky Blue Sky, and Wilco&#39;s latest release, the Grammy-nominated Wilco (The Album).</p>

<p>Regarded as one of the world’s best live bands, Wilco has performed at virtually every major jazz, rock, and folk festival in North America, Europe, Brazil, Japan, Australia and New Zealand and have headlined shows everywhere from Madison Square Garden to Tanglewood to Millennium Park to Massey Hall. The band recently became festival curators successfully launching the inaugural Solid Sound Festival in North Adams, MA.</p>

<p>Beyond Wilco, Kotche records and performs regularly with the jazz experimental duo On Fillmore. Their latest recording, Extended Vacation (Dead Oceans / BounDee, 2009) was released to critical acclaim, with the New York Times calling it “a peculiar update of early-1960s exotica, with a heart of darkness in a place of setting sun.” Their previous release, Sleeps with Fishes (Drag City, 2003 and Columbia Music Entertainment, 2007), landed them at the prestigious 2005 Percussion Pan Festival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>

Born in Meridian, MS, then raised in New York, Adams began his studies of music as a member of a rock band, and his admiration for the music of Frank Zappa led him to explore the works of Edgard Varèse, Igor Stravinsky, John Cage, and Morton Feldman. To continue his education, Adams attended the California Institute of the Arts, where he studied composition with James Tenney and Leonard Stein, graduating in 1973.</p>

<p>Adams&#39; love for nature led him to work after college as an environmentalist, and he first came to Alaska in 1975, then permanently settled there in 1978. He participated in the campaign for the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act and became executive director of the Northern Alaska Environmental Center. He also pursued his musical career, working in the 1980s as a timpanist and percussionist with the Fairbanks Symphony Orchestra and the Arctic Chamber Orchestra, all the while writing music in a wide variety of genres. He composed works for orchestra, chamber ensembles, voice, percussion, and electronics, and he created scores for film and television. Much of his music has been categorized as minimalist or new age, though the predominance of slow tempos and gradual changes of harmonies and sonorities shows a clear connection to ambient music.</p>

<p>Adams’ music is heard regularly all over the world. The Chicago Symphony, the Radio Netherlands Philharmonic, and the Melbourne Symphony have performed his Dark Waves for large orchestra and electronic sounds. Inuksuit for up to ninety-nine percussionists has been performed in New York City&#39;s Morningside Park and at the Park Avenue Armory, as well as many other outdoor venues throughout the U.S., Canada, and Australia. His music has been recorded by Cantaloupe, Cold Blue, Mode, New Albion, and New World. He is the author of Winter Music (2004), a collection of writings about his life and pursuits in Alaska. He has received awards and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rasmuson Foundation, and the Foundation for Contemporary Arts. He was named a United States Artists Fellow in 2006. For his efforts on behalf of the environment, Adams was given the Heinz Award, and he received Northwestern University&#39;s Nemmers Prize for his &quot;unique artistic vision that transcends stylistic boundaries.&quot;</p>

Though mostly self-taught as a composer, association with John Cage, Morton Feldman, David Tudor, Earle Brown, Frederic Rzewski and Cornelius Cardew have been important for him. A particular feature of his music has been to allow performers various degrees of freedom and interaction at the actual time of performance. The music is published by C.F. Peters, New York, and a good portion of it has been recorded. A number of pieces have been used by Merce Cunningham and the Cunningham Dance Company, starting in 1953.</p>

<p>Wolff has also been active as a performer and as an improviser – with, among others, Takehisa Kosugi, Steve Lacey, Keith Rowe, William Winant, Kui Dong, Larry Polansky and the group AMM. His writings on music, up to 1998, are collected in the book CUES: WRITINGS AND CONVERSATIONS, published by MusikTexte, Cologne. He has received awards and grants from the American Academy and National Institute of Arts and Letters, DAAD Berlin, the Asian Cultural Council, the Fromm Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts (the John Cage award for music) and the Mellon Foundation. He is a member of the Akademie der Kuenste in Berlin and has received an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from the California Institute of the Arts.

Portland, Maine, United States, March 16, 1948) is a notable and widely performed American composer, percussionist, and poet. He was born in Portland, Maine and grew up in Portland and central Maine, to a family that had originally come from central Maine.</p>

<p>He studied with Edward Diemente at the Hartt School of Music. In 1977, he received a DMA in composition from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where his instructors included Edward Miller, Salvatore Martirano, Herbert Brün, and Ben Johnston. He teaches at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County,[1][dead link] and has also taught at the Atlantic Center for the Arts. He served as executive editor of the Percussive Arts Research Edition from 1982 to 1984.</p>

<p>His wife is the percussionist and music publisher Sylvia Smith, who has performed many of his works. They live together in Baltimore, Maryland. His works are published by Smith Publications.</p>

<p>Smith describes himself as &quot;a confessional composer who focuses on revealing in his music the most personal aspects of his life, in the belief that the revelations of the particular speak to the universal.&quot; His music is usually chromatic, atonal, and rhythmically complex, with his pitch material selected in an intuitive manner rather than via the twelve-tone technique. Many of his works are theatrical, asking the performers to speak, sing, act, and perform pantomime in addition to playing their instruments. His works often feature improvisation. Approximately half of his more than 130 works involve percussion, and his works are particularly popular among percussionists. He has a preference for found sounds, and often utilizes household objects (such as plates, bowls, and tin cans) and objects found in nature (such as dried leaves, logs, and pod rattles) as sound sources. Many of his works are inspired by the environment and history of Maine, including ...And Points North (1990), which is about the Passamaquoddy nation of eastern Maine.</p>

<p>Recordings of Smith&#39;s music have been released on the 11 West, Capstone, Centaur, Opus One, O.O. Discs, Cadenza, BVHaast, and GAC Sweden labels. He has been awarded grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Maryland State Arts Council.</p>

Yorker) and “...among the great composers of the century” (The New York Times).. From his early taped speech pieces It&#39;s Gonna Rain (1965) and Come Out (1966) to his and video artist Beryl Korot’s digital video opera Three Tales (2002), Mr. Reich&#39;s path has embraced not only aspects of Western Classical music, but the structures, harmonies, and rhythms of non-Western and American vernacular music, particularly jazz. &quot;There&#39;s just a handful of living composers who can legitimately claim to have altered the direction of musical history and Steve Reich is one of them,&quot; states The Guardian (London).</p>

<p>In April 2009 Steve Reich was awarded the Pulitzer prize in Music for his composition &#39;Double Sextet&#39;.</p>

<p>Performing organizations around the world marked Steve Reich&#39;s 70th- birthday year, 2006, with festivals and special concerts. In the composer&#39;s hometown of New York, the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), Carnegie Hall, and Lincoln Center joined forces to present complementary programs of his music, and in London, the Barbican mounted a major retrospective. Concerts were also presented in Amsterdam, Athens, Brussels, Baden-Baden, Barcelona, Birmingham, Budapest, Chicago, Cologne, Copenhagen, Denver, Dublin, Freiburg, Graz, Helsinki, Los Angeles, Paris, Porto, Vancouver, Vienna and Vilnius among others. In addition, Nonesuch Records released its second box set of Steve Reich’s works, Phases: A Nonesuch Retrospective, in September 2006. The five-CD collection comprises fourteen of the composer’s best-known pieces, spanning the 20 years of his time on the label.</p>

<p>In October 2006 in Tokyo, Mr. Reich was awarded the Preamium Imperial award in Music. This important international award is in areas in the arts not covered by the Nobel Prize. Former winners of the prize in various fields include Pierre Boulez, Lucian Berio, Gyorgy Ligeti, Willem de Kooning, Jasper Johns, Richard Serra and Stephen Sondheim.</p>

<p>In May 2007 Mr. Reich was awarded The Polar Prize from the Royal Swedish Academy of music. The prize was presented by His Majesty King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. The Swedish Academy said: &quot;...Steve Reich has transferred questions of faith, society and philosophy into a hypnotic sounding music that has inspired musicians and composers of all genres.&quot; Former winners of the Polar Prize have included Pierre Boulez, Bob Dylan, Gyorgi Ligeti and Sir Paul McCartney.</p>

<p>In December 2006 Mr. Reich was awarded membership in the Franz Liszt Academy in Budapest and in April 2007 he was awarded the Chubb Fellowship at Yale University. In May 2008 he was elected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.</p>

<p>Born in New York and raised there and in California, Mr. Reich graduated with honors in philosophy from Cornell University in 1957. For the next two years, he studied composition with Hall Overton, and from 1958 to 1961 he studied at the Juilliard School of Music with William Bergsma and Vincent Persichetti. Mr. Reich received his M.A. in Music from Mills College in 1963, where he worked with Luciano Berio and Darius Milhaud.</p>

<p>During the summer of 1970, with the help of a grant from the Institute for International Education, Mr. Reich studied drumming at the Institute for African Studies at the University of Ghana in Accra. In 1973 and 1974 he studied Balinese Gamelan Semar Pegulingan and Gamelan Gambang at the American Society for Eastern Arts in Seattle and Berkeley, California. From 1976 to 1977 he studied the traditional forms of cantillation (chanting) of the Hebrew scriptures in New York and Jerusalem.</p>

<p>In 1966 Steve Reich founded his own ensemble of three musicians, which rapidly grew to 18 members or more. Since 1971, Steve Reich and Musicians have frequently toured the world, and have the distinction of performing to sold-out houses at venues as diverse as Carnegie Hall and the Bottom Line Cabaret.</p>

<p>Mr. Reich&#39;s 1988 piece, Different Trains, marked a new compositional method, rooted in It&#39;s Gonna Rain and Come Out, in which speech recordings generate the musical material for musical instruments. The New York Times hailed Different Trains as &quot;a work of such astonishing originality that breakthrough seems the only possible description....possesses an absolutely harrowing emotional impact.&quot; In 1990, Mr. Reich received a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Composition for Different Trains as recorded by the Kronos Quartet on the Nonesuch label.</p>

<p>In June 1997, in celebration of Mr. Reich&#39;s 60th birthday, Nonesuch released a 10-CD retrospective box set of Mr. Reich&#39;s compositions, featuring several newly-recorded and re-mastered works. He won a second Grammy award in 1999 for his piece Music for 18 Musicians, also on the Nonesuch label. In July 1999 a major retrospective of Mr. Reich’s work was presented by the Lincoln Center Festival. Earlier, in 1988, the South Bank Centre in London, mounted a similar series of retrospective concerts.</p>

<p>In 2000 he was awarded the Schuman Prize from Columbia University, the Montgomery Fellowship from Dartmouth College, the Regent’s Lectureship at the University of California at Berkeley, an honorary doctorate from the California Institute of the Arts and was named Composer of the Year by Musical America magazine.</p>

<p>The Cave, Steve Reich and Beryl Korot&#39;s music theater video piece exploring the Biblical story of Abraham, Sarah, Hagar, Ishmael and Isaac, was hailed by Time Magazine as &quot;a fascinating glimpse of what opera might be like in the 21st century.&quot; Of the Chicago premiere, John von Rhein of the Chicago Tribune wrote, &quot;The techniques embraced by this work have the potential to enrich opera as living art a thousandfold....The Cave impresses, ultimately, as a powerful and imaginative work of high-tech music theater that brings the troubled present into resonant dialogue with the ancient past, and invites all of us to consider anew our shared cultural heritage.&quot;</p>

<p>Three Tales, a three-part digital documentary video opera, is a second collaborative work by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot about three well known events from the twentieth century, reflecting on the growth and implications of technology in the 20th century: Hindenburg, on the crash of the German zeppelin in New Jersey in 1937; Bikini, on the Atom bomb tests at Bikini atoll in 1946-1954; and Dolly, the sheep cloned in 1997, on the issues of genetic engineering and robotics. Three Tales is a three act music theater work in which historical film and video footage, video taped interviews, photographs, text, and specially constructed stills are recreated on computer, transferred to video tape and projected on one large screen. Musicians and singers take their places on stage along with the screen, presenting the debate about the physical, ethical and religious nature of technological development.

The Dairy, the two-story building with the cupola in the photo, was originally constructed as a one-story building in 1813. A second story was added in 1825, and an addition was made to the east side of the building later. The cupola was part of a ventilation system designed to keep the building cool, a necessity in the production of dairy products.</p>

<p>The Laundry building was originally a two-story structure built in 1813. In 1833 a large addition was made to the east side and the entire third story was added. This addition contained water-powered machinery, fed with water from the mill pond behind the Stone Mill on the west side of the main road. The drying room was heated by steam provided by a boiler in the 1854 Cow Barn.</p>

<p>The long single story addition to the Dairy was constructed in 1944 by the La Salette Brothers and has had a variety of uses, most recently serving as the home of the Museum Store.</p>

Its presence was imposing, as seen in this historic photo taken from the Stone Mill Building.</p>

<p>The first floor is primarily dedicated to preparing and eating the community&#39;s meals. The second floor housed the Meeting Room as well as 4 dwelling rooms. The third and fourth floors contained 8 dwelling rooms per floor, each room measuring approximately 20&#39; x 20&#39;. The fifth and sixth floor attic spaces were storage and work space.</p>

<p>In addition to the above mentioned rooms, a stunning array of built in drawers and cupboards, closets, and pegrails are found throughout the building. In short, it contained all the innovations the Shakers could conceive of to make their temporal home the reflection of the spiritual perfection they pursued in their communal lives here in Enfield.</p>
